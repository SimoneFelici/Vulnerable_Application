# VULNERABLE APPLICATION

## BUILD

- Inside the backend folder:


```bash
  mvn clean package
```

- In the root directory:


```bash
  docker compose up --build
```
## Vulnerabilities
The file [vulns.md](https://github.com/SimoneFelici/Vulnerable_Application/blob/main/vulns.md) has the full (I hope so) list of vulnerabilities.

## Endpoints
You can refer to the file [ips.txt](https://github.com/SimoneFelici/Vulnerable_Application/blob/main/ips.txt) for the full (I hope so) list of endpoints.

## PoCs
I made some PoCs in the file [pocs.md](https://github.com/SimoneFelici/Vulnerable_Application/blob/main/pocs.md)

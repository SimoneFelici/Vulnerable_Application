# VULNERABLE APPLICATION

## BUILD

- Inside the backend folder:


```bash
  mvn clean package
```

- In the root directory:


```bash
  docker compose up --build
```
## Endpoints
You can refer to the file ips.txt for the full (I hope so) list of endpoints.

## PoCs
I made some PoCs in the file pocs.md
